This `node_modules` folder is not generated by a package manager.
It is manually created, to use node's resolution algorithms in fixture options
to resolve providers defined in this monorepo.

e.g. "@@/babel-polyfill-provider-regeneretor" instead of
"../../../../../babel-polyfill-provider-regeneretor"
